# Deployment

This game uses **PeerJS** for peer-to-peer multiplayer. This means there is NO backend server to deploy.

## How to Deploy
1.  Push this code to **GitHub**.
2.  Import the repository into **Vercel**.
3.  Click **Deploy**.

That's it! The standard Vercel URL (e.g., `https://nissi-samurai.vercel.app`) will work for both local and online multiplayer.
